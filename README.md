# EcoSentinel

### AI-Powered Environmental Monitoring Platform

EcoSentinel is a planet-scale environmental monitoring platform that uses AI and real satellite imagery to detect critical environmental changes such as deforestation, pollution spread, and water-level variations in near real time.

Featuring a futuristic, space-themed interface, EcoSentinel acts as a mission control system for Earth, enabling authorities, researchers, and organizations to observe environmental risks early and respond with data-driven confidence.

## Why EcoSentinel?

Environmental damage often goes unnoticed until it becomes irreversible. Satellite data exists, but it is:

- Fragmented across platforms
- Manually analyzed
- Delayed in reaching decision-makers

EcoSentinel solves this by combining live satellite data, AI-based change detection, and intuitive visualization into one unified system.

## Key Features

- **Global Monitoring** - Continuous Earth observation using real satellite data
- **Live Satellite Imagery** - Before/After comparisons from trusted satellite sources
- **AI-Driven Change Detection** - Automated detection of deforestation, pollution, and water loss
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Map-based visualization with environmental layers
- **Recent Actions Timeline** - Time-stamped environmental events detected by the system
- **Immersive Cosmic UI** - Mission-control style interface with subtle parallax and animations

---

## System Architecture

1. **Satellite Data Ingestion** - Live data pulled from public global APIs
2. **Preprocessing Pipeline** - Image normalization and temporal alignment
3. **AI Analysis Layer** - Computer vision models detect changes over time
4. **Risk Classification** - Severity scoring and categorization
5. **Visualization & Alerts** - Insights displayed on a real-time dashboard

## Data Sources

EcoSentinel integrates data from globally trusted sources:

- **NASA Earthdata** - Satellite imagery
- **Copernicus Sentinel-2** - Land & water monitoring
- **Global Forest Watch** - Deforestation data
- **OpenAQ** - Air pollution metrics
- **NOAA** - Water levels and climate indicators

> All insights are driven by real data.
> Any simulated AI inference is clearly labeled and data-backed.
